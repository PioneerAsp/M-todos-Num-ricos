# Numerical-methods
Programs created in the Numerical Methods class in python language:
- Newton's method which is an algorithm to find approximations of the zeros or roots of a real function.
- Simpson's rule which is a method that calculates a definite integral by calculating the area of overlap of parabolic segments in the interval of integration and then adding them.
- Trapezium Rule in essence, the technique consists of dividing the total interval into small intervals and approximating the curve Y = f(X) in the various small intervals by some simpler curve whose integral can be calculated using only the ordinates of the endpoints of the intervals.
- The iterative methods of Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel are the processes of successive approximations to solve systems of compatible linear equations. Both require the verification of a convergence criterion commonly known as heavy diagonal.
- Operations with matrices: The operations with matrices are addition, subtraction, division and multiplication. A matrix is the inverse of another when multiplying both (in any order) yields the identity matrix. If they can be multiplied in any order, they must be square matrices (Anxn·A-1nxn=A-1nxn·Anxn=Inxn). It can also be observed that if we do the inverse of the inverse, the original matrix is obtained.
